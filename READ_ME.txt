#include "../lib/uopmsb/uop_msb_2_0_0.h"
using namespace uop_msb_200;


Put this at the top of your code, just underneath #include "mbed.h", to include the module support board :))


As a side note, this is recommended per  the criteria of the group coursework, and do us well at the end of the programming section

TIP - Note this is the code you will use in your presentation. Every year, at least one group submits the wrong code and loses marks. To avoid this, get one member to submit the work and another to download the submitted work on a different computer, build and test
